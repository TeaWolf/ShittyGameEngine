Change the texture manager into some kind of sprite object system (maybe... think about effeciency)
Study the effeciency of singleton classes
Study effeciency of repeadetly calling a function of storing the value
Do some better documentation in general (do some research online)
Maybe consider renaming some shit
Make sure that ressources are cleaned up properly and that there are no memory leaks
Maybe reorganize the files a bit... folders?
Rework the ObjectLoadParameters class, maybe think of an alternative to that model
Implement some delta time for better physics
Better error checking in some situations
Implement the rest of the joystick stuff and keyboard
