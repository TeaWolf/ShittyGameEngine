Change the texture manager into some kind of sprite object system (maybe... think about effeciency)
Study the effeciency of singleton classes
Do some better documentation in general (do some research online)
Maybe consider renaming some shit
Make sure that ressources are cleaned up properly and that there are no memory leaks
Maybe reorganize the files a bit... folders?
Rework the ObjectLoadParameters class
